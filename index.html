                                    In the introduction with Laura tells you to be sure to have clean. She's on point.
                                    I found myself crying a lot but not always with sadness.
                                    It's really a wonderful book with some amazing stories.
                                    If your faith is wavering and you need some uplift, this is the book for you.
